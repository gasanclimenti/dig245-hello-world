  <h2>Hello World Assignment</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gaby Sanclimenti / sophomore / intended psychology major</li>
    <li>I am taking this course because web design seemed interesting to me. I have had minimal experience, but the information I learned was really fun to me.</li>
    <li>As I have mentioned, I do not have a lot of experience. Most of it came from summer camps a long time ago.</li>
    <li>My goal in this course is to gain a basic grasp of web design that could hopefully prove somewhat useful in a future career.</li>
    <li>Learn-Computing:
      <ul>
        <li>File Organization & Naming Conventions: This learning-computing lesson explains the importance of clearly-labeled files. Organizing and structuring files can feel tedious but pays off as you return to the files in the future. Using full descriptions and dates in the names of your files can help for easy access to the exact file you are looking for. File names should not include spaces and be written in all lowercase, or another common naming convention.</li>
        <li>The Filesystem: This learn-computing lesson talked about files as organizers of data, which are then organized into folders, which are organized into programs. Users can have access to these files through permissions, which include options to read (r), write (w), and/or execute (x) the file. Files are organized into heirarchical systems, which are contained by the root and can be located through paths. Certain files include extensions to identify the type of file they are. Additionally, files can be hidden.
      </ul>
    <li>Web-Based Projects (selected from the spreadsheet list):
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://teropa.info/loop/#/title" target="_blank">How Generative Music Works:</a> This project described how music was generated digitally through different software. Each piece of music is created by different systems, which were created by the music-makers (the system, not the musician, creates the songs). It was especially interesting to see the balance between randomness and structured logic; the software systems, which were created through logic and specific, direct instructions, caused randomness to make original music.</li>
          <li><a href="http://species-in-pieces.com/#" target="_blank">Species In Pieces:</a> This exhibition utilizes CSS to display pictures of and information on 30 endangered animals. The project helps raise awareness about the effects of human damage on the world's ecosystems through a clean, geometric, and visually-appealing design.</li>
          <li><a href="https://fugitivetexts.net/twomoji/" target="_blank">Two Moji:</a> This project uses emojis to tell randomized stories of love, divorce, murder, and other situations. The emojis that are generated appear to be picked by random, providing a unique scenario each time. Personally, this project creates many intruiging and original story starters to use for future writing.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
